Code from 2023 iteration of Wildlife Ecology & Management at UL-Lafayette.

Assumes starting from little to no R exposure and builds up to working with simple population viability analysis (PVA) models.

The R portion of the lab only meets 6-7 times over the whole semester - could benefit from more regular R reinforcement.
