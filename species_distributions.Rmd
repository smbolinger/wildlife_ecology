We can use R to make maps of global species distributions.

First, we'll load this trusty package:

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
```

To create our maps, we have a new package we need to use. 
Remember what we do to load it into R?

```{r}

library(dismo)
```

Below I have examples of species listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN
RedList. We will use the gbif function from the dismo package to download worldwide species occurrence data.

What are the benefits and drawbacks to using publicly-sourced data from around the globe?

Pick one species below. You will see that you use the scientific name in the gbif function.

*What can you do to make sure R only downloads data for one of the species when you hit the Run button?*

You can comment out the other lines by adding `#` in front of them! I already did this with the bird species, which has tons of observations and would take forever to download. Add `#` to every line beginning with "species" except for the line with the species you want to look at. 

*If you don't do this, you'll be downloading the data for one species and then overwriting it with the next species*

```{r}

# An aquatic species:

species = gbif("Eubalaena", "glacialis") 


# A terrestrial species:

species <- gbif("Spilogale", "putorius")


# An amphibian:

species <- gbif("Ambystoma", "californiense")


# A bird:

#species = gbif("Diomedea", "exulans") 

```

Once we have the data, we can graph species occurrences per year. 

Take a look at your dataframe. We can verify that it is a dataframe using:

```{r}
class(species)
```

What are the column names? Which ones will be relevant to us? 
An easy way to see all the column names in a dataframe is:

```{r}
names(species)
```

That's a lot of information (it's actually 2 columns of names!) and we only want to use a small subset of it.

Printing the names like this will help you in filtering your data, because you can tell R to use certain columns based on their names.

We can also look at specific variables to see what might be useful:

```{r}
table(species$country)
```

```{r}
table(species$year)
```
```{r}
table(species$sex)
```

Which of the above variables would be most useful? Least useful?

In order to select just the data we want, we will be using some data-cleaning functions from the package dplyr. This package contains all kinds of functions to manipulate, clean, and filter your data. 

```{r}
# For example, if I wanted the year, latitude, and longitude, I would use:

sp_GPS <- species |> 
  dplyr::select(year, lat, lon)

# Don't panic! I will provide the code for you and you can just replace the bits you need to.

```


We'll choose to plot occurrences since 1990. First, we will select only the columns we need and filter them to the years we want. I've selected year and then a few other columns that could be interesting.

```{r}
# ************ FOR ALL SPECIES: ************************************************

# select the species and year columns, and filter

sp_year <- species %>%
  dplyr::select(species, year, occurrenceID, country, month) %>%
  filter( year >= 1990 & year < 2009)

# create a new dataframe of occurrences by year
sp_occ <- sp_year |>
  group_by(year) |>
  mutate(n_occ = n_distinct(occurrenceID)) %>%
  ungroup()

```

What's with the |> ?

These are pipes! Many people find that pipes make data analysis much easier. We are "piping" our data along to the different functions we use like group_by and filter, so we don't have to specify which data we are using again and again. For example:

```{r}
# We could do this to get the same result as above:

sp_year <- subset(species, select = c("species", "year","occurrenceID", "country", "month"))
sp_year <- sp_year[species$year >= 1990 & species$year < 2009,]
sp_year <- sp_year[!is.na(sp_year$year),]

sp_occ2 <- mutate(sp_year, .by=year, n_occ=length(species))

# Looks like fun, right???
# You also have to keep track of when to put variable names in quotes or not and other fun things
# So instead, we will use dplyr as shown above!


```

Since we used the name "sp_year" again, R wrote over the old sp_year with what we just did. But what happened to sp_occ?

The new sp_occ should be identical.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Making some graphs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a sense, the ggplot2 package works similarly to dplyr. You create a base graph where you tell R what you want x and y to be, and then you add the elements you want.


```{r}

ggplot(data=sp_occ, aes(x=year,y=n_occ)) 

```

By itself, that function does nothing because it's just specifying what y and x are, and what data we are using. You need to add to the plot:


```{r}

ggplot(data=sp_occ, aes(x=year,y=n_occ)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity")
  
```

Now that I chose a plot type, I can add fun colors and whatnot:

```{r}

ggplot(data=sp_occ, aes(x=year,y=n_occ)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="burlywood4")
```

You can also change the fill color to represent a variable.

You might also want to add nicer labels.

There are tons and tons of modifications you can do! 
(the ggplot2 cheatsheet can be helpful)

```{r}

ggplot(data=sp_occ, aes(x=year,y=n_occ)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", aes(fill = month)) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of Occurrences")
```

I could change the x-axis to show every year, or change how tall the y-axis is, or any number of things, but we won't get carried away today. 

How does occurrence of your species vary over time?
Does this mean the actual population varied that much?


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Maps
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And now, the fun part. Let's make a map of the species occurrences. We will need another new package, which RStudio has probably already prompted you to install.


```{r}
library(maps)
library(rgdal)
library(sf)

```

first we will rename "lon" to "long" and load the world map. 


```{r}

worldMap <- map_data("world")

names(sp_GPS)[3] <- "long"

ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(data=worldMap, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group), fill="orchid3")



```

it's a map of the world! cool. now let's plot our species occurrence data. these are the gps locations for sightings or captures of the species.  

```{r}

ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(data=worldMap, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group)) +
# coord_fixed(1.3) +
  geom_point(data=sp_GPS, aes(x=long, y=lat), color="cadetblue4")
```

What is the warning message at the top of your map? 

Is it surprising that gps coordinates are missing for so many points? 

Are all the points where you would expect? why do you think this is?





```{r}
#load library
library(sf)
#load geojson from url
# distMap <- read_sf("data_0.shp")
distMap <- st_read(file.path("redlist_species_data_e_glacialis/data_0.shp"))
#quick view to see what we're dealing with
mapview::mapview(distMap)
distMap <- fortify(distMap)

ggplot(data=worldMap, aes(x=long, y=lat)) +
  # geom_polygon(data=worldMap, aes(x = long, y = lat, group=group)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(group=group)) +
  geom_polygon(data = distMap, fill = "orangered")
```
